## Welcome to counterðŸ‘‹

This project was created for the practical exam of the Javascript Basic course at Start2Impact University.

The goal was to develop a JavaScript application that allows the user to increase and decrease the value of the counter. Upon entering the page, the user will see 0 as the counter value and will have two +/- buttons available to change the counter value.
